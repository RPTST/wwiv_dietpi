WWIV 5.0 Getting Started
========================
If you already have WWIV 5.0 installed, just copy the EXE and DLL files over
your existing 4.30 installation. (please backup your previous binaries and
configuration files)

Run WWIV5TelnetServer.exe and then select the menu Edit > Preferences and setup
the information for your configuration (paths, and the starting and ending
node numbers to use for inbound telnet). Then choose File > Start Server.
Now the WWIV5TelnetServer (WTS) is listening on a socket and ready to spawn 
instances of WWIV.  You do not need to keep multiple copies of WWIV running
at all times, as the WTS will spawn them as required.

*** Be sure to read WHATSNEW.TXT for a list of all the new major features and
other changes that have happened since 4.30. ***

NOTE: Serial I/O Support does not work.  Use one of the serial -> telnet
bridges for "Dial Up" support.
